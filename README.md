# My Website Navbar Component

This is a simple and responsive navigation bar component built using React and Tailwind CSS. It adapts its layout based on the screen width, displaying a hamburger menu icon on smaller screens and a horizontal list of links on larger screens.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Automatically switches between a hamburger menu and a horizontal navigation list based on screen size (breakpoint at 768px).
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling, ensuring a consistent and easily customizable look.
- **Basic Navigation Links:** Includes placeholder links for "Home," "About," and "Contact."
- **Hover Effect:** Provides a subtle underline effect on the navigation links when hovered over.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. If you haven't already, install React and Tailwind CSS in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   # or
   yarn add react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

## Configure Tailwind CSS in your postcss.config.js file:
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};



## Configure Tailwind CSS in your tailwind.config.js file
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./public/index.html",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

##  Explanation
useState(window.innerWidth): Initializes a state variable width with the initial width of the browser window.
useEffect(...): This hook manages the side effect of listening for window resize events.
handleResize(): A function that updates the width state with the current window width.
window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize): Attaches an event listener to the window object that calls handleResize whenever the window is resized.
return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);: This is the cleanup function. It's crucial to remove the event listener when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks. The empty dependency array [] ensures that this effect runs only once after the initial render and the cleanup runs when the component is unmounted.
Conditional Rendering: The component uses a ternary operator (width < 768 ? ... : ...) to conditionally render either a hamburger menu icon (for smaller screens) or a list of navigation links (for larger screens).
Tailwind CSS Classes: The nav, h1, ul, and li elements are styled using Tailwind CSS classes for background color (bg-blue-600), text color (text-white), padding (p-4), flexbox layout (flex justify-between items-center, flex gap-6), text size (text-lg, text-2xl), font weight (font-semibold), and hover effect (hover:underline cursor-pointer).
## Customization
Breakpoint: You can adjust the screen width breakpoint (currently 768px) by modifying the condition in the conditional rendering logic.
Styling: Customize the appearance of the navbar by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes applied to the elements. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for available classes.
Navigation Links: Update the text and add more <li> elements within the <ul> to include additional navigation links. You'll likely want to replace the placeholder cursor-pointer with actual link functionality using React Router or similar.
Hamburger Menu Functionality: This version only displays the hamburger menu icon. You'll need to add additional state and logic to handle the opening and closing of the menu and the display of the navigation links when the hamburger menu is clicked.
